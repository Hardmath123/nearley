Simple parsing for node.js.

What is nearley?
----------------
nearley uses the Earley parsing algorithm to parse complex data structures
easily. nearley is Ã¼ber-fast and really powerful. It can parse anything you
throw at it.

nearley is used by [artificial
intelligence](https://github.com/AI-course-TIN172-DIT410/shrdlite-course-project)
and [computational
linguistics](https://wiki.eecs.yorku.ca/course_archive/2014-15/W/6339/useful_handouts)
classes at universities, as well as [file format
parsers](https://github.com/raymond-h/node-dmi), [markup
languages](https://github.com/bobbybee/uPresent) and [complete programming
languages](https://github.com/bobbybee/carbon). It's an npm [staff
pick](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-collection-staff-picks).

Why do I care?
--------------

nearley can parse what other JS parse engines cannot, because it uses a
different algorithm. The Earley algorithm is *general*, which means it can
handle *any* grammar you can define in BNF. In fact, the nearley syntax is
written in *itself* (this is called bootstrapping).

PEGjs and Jison are recursive-descent based, and so they will choke on a lot of
grammars, in particular [left recursive
ones](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_recursion).

nearley also has capabilities to catch errors gracefully, and detect ambiguous
grammars (grammars that can be parsed in multiple ways).

Installation and Usage
----------------------
To compile a parser, use the `nearleyc` command:

    npm install -g nearley
    nearleyc parser.ne

Run `nearleyc --help` for more options.

To use a generated grammar in a node runtime, install `nearley` as a module:

    npm install nearley
    ...
    var nearley = require("nearley");
    var grammar = require("./my-generated-grammar.js");

To use a generated grammar in a browser runtime, include `nearley.js` (you can
hardlink from Github if you want):

    <script src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hardmath123/nearley/master/nearley.js"></script>
    <script src="my-generated-grammar.js"></script>


Parser specification
--------------------

This is a basic overview of nearley syntax and usage. For an advanced
styleguide, see [this file](how-to-grammar-good.md).

A parser consists of several *nonterminals*, which are constructions in a
language. A nonterminal is made up of a series of either other nonterminals or
strings. In nearley, you define a nonterminal by giving its name and its
expansions.

The following grammar matches a number, a plus sign, and another number
(anything from a `#` to the end of a line is ignored as a comment):

    expression -> number "+" number

A nonterminal can have multiple expansions, separated by pipes (`|`):

    expression ->
          number "+" number
        | number "-" number
        | number "*" number
        | number "/" number

The parser tries to parse the first nonterminal that you define in a file.
However, you can (and should!) introduce more nonterminals as "helpers". In
this example, we would have to define the expansion of `number`.

### Postprocessors

Each meaning (called a *production rule*) can have a postprocessing function,
that can format the data in a way that you would like:

    expression -> number "+" number {%
        function (data, location, reject) {
            return ["sum", data[0], data[2]];
        }
    %}

`data` is an array whose elements match the nonterminals in order. The
postprocessor `id` returns the first token in the match (literally
`function(data) {data[0];}`).

`location` is the index at which that rule was found. Retaining this
information in a syntax tree is useful if you're writing an interpreter and
want to give fancy error messages for runtime errors. (This feature is
**experimental**.)

If, after examining the data, you want to force the rule to fail anyway, return
`reject`. An example of this is allowing a variable name to be a word that is
not a string:

```
variable -> word {%
    function(data, location, reject) {
        if (KEYWORDS.indexOf(data[0]) === -1) {
            return data[0]; // It's a valid name 
        } else {
            return reject;  // It's a keyword, so reject it
        }
    }
%}
```

### Epsilon rules

The **epsilon rule** is the empty rule that matches nothing. The constant
`null` is the epsilon rule, so:

    a -> null
        | a "cow"

will match 0 or more `cow`s in a row.

### Charsets

You can use valid RegExp charsets in a rule:

    not_a_letter -> [^a-zA-Z]

The `.` character can be used to represent "any character".

### EBNF

nearley compiles some higher-level constructs into BNF for you. In particular,
the `*`, `?`, and `+` operators from Regexes (or EBNF) are available as shown:

    batman -> "na":* "batman" # nananana...nanabatman

You can also use capture groups with parentheses. Its contents can be anything
that a rule can have:

    banana -> "ba" ("na" {% id %} | "NA" {% id %}):+

### Other

For more intricate postprocessors, or any other functionality you may need, you
can include parts of literal JavaScript between production rules by surrounding
it with `@{% ... %}`:

    @{% var makeCowWithString = require('./cow.js') %}
    cow -> "moo" {% function(d) {makeCowWithString(d[0]); } %}

Note that it doesn't matter where you define these; they all get hoisted to the
top of the generated code.

Using a parser
--------------

nearley exposes the following API:

    var grammar = require("generated-code.js");
    var nearley = require("nearley");

    // Create a Parser object from our grammar.
    var p = new nearley.Parser(grammar.ParserRules, grammar.ParserStart);

    // Parse something
    p.feed("1+1");
    // p.results --> [ ["sum", "1", "1"] ]

The `Parser` object can be fed data in parts with `.feed(data)`. You can then
find an array of parsings with the `.results` property. If `results` is empty,
then there are no parsings. If `results` contains multiple values, then that
combination is ambiguous.

The incremental feeding design is inspired so that you can parse data from
stream-like inputs, or even dynamic readline inputs. For example, to create a
Python-style REPL where it continues to prompt you until you have entered a
complete block.

    p.feed(prompt_user(">>> "));
    while (p.results.length < 1) {
        p.feed(prompt_user("... "));
    }
    console.log(p.results);

Exploring a parser interactively
--------------------------------

The global install will provide `nearley-test`, a simple command-line tool you
can use to inspect what a parser is doing. You input a generated `grammar.js`
file, and then give it some input to test the parser against. `nearley-test`
prints out the output if successful, and also gives you the complete parse
table used by the algorithm. This is very helpful when you're testing a new
parser.

This was previously called `bin/nearleythere.js` and written by Robin.

Still confused?
---------------
You can read [the calculator example](examples/calculator/arithmetic.ne) to get
a feel for the syntax (see it live
[here](http://hardmath123.github.io/nearley/examples/calculator/)). There are
more sample grammars in the `/examples` directory. For larger examples,  we
also have experimental parsers for **CSV**, **Lua**, and **JavaScript**.

Catching errors
---------------

If there are no possible parsings, nearley will throw an error whose `offset`
property is the index of the offending token.

    try {
        p.feed("1+gorgonzola");
    } catch(parseError) {
        console.log(
            "Error at character " + parseError.offset
        ); // "Error at character 2"
    }


Contributing
------------

Clone, hack, PR. Tests live in `test/` and can be called with `npm test`. Make
sure you read `test/profile.log` after tests run, and that nothing has died
(parsing is tricky, and small changes can kill efficiency).

If you're looking for something to do, here's a short list of things that would
make me happy:

- Optimize. There are still plenty of optimizations that an enterprising
  JS-savant could implement. In particular, I haven't focused much on
  optimizing the memory usage.
- Implement Joop Leo's right-recursion algorithm.
- Ports to other languages! `pearley` for Python and `cearley` for C would be
  awesome.

A big thanks to Nathan Dinsmore for teaching me how to Earley, Aria Stewart for
helping structure nearley into a mature module, and Robin Windels for
bootstrapping the grammar. Additionally, Jacob Edelman wrote an experimental
JavaScript parser with nearley and contributed ideas for EBNF support.
